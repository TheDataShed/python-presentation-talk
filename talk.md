# My Python History

<span class="row">

<span class="col-12">

Just 12 months ago I knew **NO** Python.

I had **NEVER** used it before.

My background was **Microsoft** using C# and SQL Server.

I landed on a project which was pretty much all **Python**...

The fear kicked in. I was being made to leave my cosy, capitalist Microsoft bubble.

# Initial Thoughts

- Python was naff
- Why is this such a pain to get installed?
- Where are the brackets, braces and semi-colons?
- This isn't real programming

---

# Learning

- Installing the bloody thing
- Initial syntax
- Tried to build a factory pattern ðŸ˜‚ (and kind of succeeded?)
- List comprehension
- This UnitTest mocking is insane
- Wtf is a "dunder method"

---

# Where are we now?

- Still a pain to install (on an M1 Mac at least)
- It's grown on me...a lot
- Dataclasses/Pydantic
- List comprehension is mega
- Super quick to get started (once installed)
- A package for just about anything
