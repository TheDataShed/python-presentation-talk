# Python

## Past, Present & Future

# Python in the Present

Present day Python from a total newbie's perspective.

# My ~~Python~~ History

- Just 12 months ago I knew **NO** Python.
- I had **NEVER** used it before.
- My background was **Microsoft** using C# and SQL Server.

# Installation

Literally the worst.

- Clean M1 Mac
- Conflicts with pre-installed Python
- Packages and other bits not working on M1
- Updates required to XCode Command Line Tools
- Homebrew got buggered
- Fudging `~/.zshrc` with environment variables

This part of the process still **SUCKS** in my opinion. It shouldn't take me half a day to fix all this crap.

# Learning

Using Python for the first time meant **A LOT** of learning. Here's some of the stuff I learned...

---

# Syntax

- No curly braces!
- No semi-colons!
- WHERE IS THE MIS-INDENTED LINE?!

---

# Importy Stuff

The process of importing my first module:

1. That module definitely exists.
1. That module most definitely exists.
1. THE MODULE MOST DEFINITELY EXISTS YOU STUPID THING.
1. Oh, the `init` file only has one `_` at the start...

# Unit Test Mocking

This took me bloody ages but was an absolute saviour.

Definitely one of those things where reading doesn't help too much.

Thanks to George for spending hours sitting with me and helping me learn this.

Eventually one day, it clicks.

---

# Virtual Environments

Make sure you do all of your tinkering in a `venv`.

I learnt this the hard way.

---

# List Comprehension

This feature is ace!

It's like _Linq_ but miles easier to remember how to do.

Great for grabbing things from lists (and stuff) without having loops all over.

---

# `*args` and `**kwargs`

Pretty much swallows up arguments that aren't declared as positional arguments.

**SUPER** useful for creating instances of _model_ objects when you're reading in data.

---

# Where am I now?

What are my thoughts on it all now?

---

# Installation

Mentioned before but this bit sucks.

Would maybe put me off using Python if was a complete beginner.

---

# A Package for Everything

No matter what you need, there's a package for it... that's great!

Whether they're any good or not, different question.

Having `pip` and access to whole world of stuff is great.

Don't reinvent the wheel!

---

# Rapid Development

Once it's installed, Python is super quick to start developing with.

It's great for fiddling with things or if you need to write a quick script to automate a rubbish task or something.

Much more lightweight than `C#`.

---

# Le Conclusion

- I am a Python convert
- It's only becoming more popular
- Coding classes that used to teach Java are now teaching Python
- There genuinely is (or seems to be) a package for everything
- It does not take long to pick up this language
- Installing Python is so bad
